# that-cat-page

A page just dedicated to displaying random cat images to put a smile on your face.

Built with Vanilla JS and SCSS, utilising the [The Cat Api](https://thecatapi.com/) to make the image calls.

I really just wanted to build something with the goal of learning SCSS before I attempt rebuilding my portfolio.

I also intend to publish the page for all the cat lovers out there.
